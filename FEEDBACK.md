## Open Items

### Warnings (non-blocking)

1. **Module 01 Exercise 1d placement**: Exercise 1d (WinGet) appears after Exercises 2-3 in the file. Ideally all installation alternatives (1a-1d) should be grouped together before Exercise 2 (Authenticate). Consider reordering.
2. **Module 02 `ctrl+e` dual function**: `ctrl+e` has two functions depending on context — "expand all timeline" (when no input) vs "cycle to end of line" (v0.0.413+ in edit mode). Merged into single row with contextual note. Users may still find this confusing.
3. **Module 02 `Shift+Tab` mode names**: Module 02 uses "(suggest) ⟷ (normal)" while Module 12 uses "(chat) ⟷ (command)". Both describe the same behavior from v0.0.410+ but use different terminology. Consider standardizing.
4. **Module 04 example links**: `llm.txt` exercise contains example links (`/docs/api.md`, `/docs/adr/`, `/CONTRIBUTING.md`) that point to non-existent files. These are intentionally example content but trigger false positives in automated link checkers.
5. **Module 03 Exercise 7**: Uses `copilot --share` and `copilot --share-gist` CLI flags to export sessions. The in-session `/share` slash command (documented in Exercise 1 note) may be more intuitive for users already in a session.
6. **Module 12**: Has `### Resources` subsection under the completion section instead of a top-level `## References` section. A `## References` section was added for structural consistency, but the `### Resources` subsection remains as well.
